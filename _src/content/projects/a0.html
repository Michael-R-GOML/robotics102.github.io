  <h2 id="getting_code">Getting the code</h2>

  <p>We will use Repl.it for Project 0. To accept the assignment, navigate to the <a href="https://replit.com/team/robotics-102-f22">ROB 102 Repl.it team</a> and open <b>Project 0: Pocket Calculator</b>.</p>

  <p>Follow the <a href="/tutorials/replit.html">Repl.it Instructions</a> to learn how to write, run, test, and submit your code.</p>

  <h2 id="project">Project Description</h2>

    <p>This project will introduce programming concepts in C++. The goal of the following activities is to prepare you to implement algorithms in C++. All the code will be compiled and executed in Repl.it.</p>

  <h3 id="pocket_calc">Programming a Pocket Calculator (15 points)</h3>

    <p>During lecture, we will go through how to program a pocket calculator in C++. You should implement the calculator in the provided template file, which is called <code>main.cpp</code>.

    <h4>Features: Pocket Calculator</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>We will go through implementing these features to build up our pocket calculator together in class.</strong>
      The list of features below summarizes the steps we will cover in class (see the <a href="/index.html#sec_schedule">schedule</a> for links to lecture content). Use them as a checklist before <a href="#submitting">submitting your assignment</a>.
      You are welcome to work on the assignment on your own time if you would like.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_1">P0.1.1 (2 points):</strong>
        Write statements that perform arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two integers stored in variables. The result of each operation must be a number.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_2">P0.1.2 (2 points):</strong>
        Create a function that can prompt a user to enter a real number and have the function return this number.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_3">P0.1.3 (3 points):</strong>
        Create a function with four parameters that performs a single arithmetic operation on two floating point operands based on the operator specified in a character variable.  The result of the operation is returned in a parameter that is passed by reference.  The program must quit if non arithmetic operation is specified.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_4">P0.1.4 (3 points):</strong>
        Develop an execution loop that performs an infinite number of subsequent arithmetic operations from user input, until the user specifies the operator &apos;q&apos; for quit.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_5">P0.1.5 (3 points):</strong>
        Output the result accumulated over subsequently performed operations as an equation that conforms to infix notation.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_6">P0.1.6 (2 points):</strong>
        Enable the user to undo their last operation by specifying &apos;u&apos; as the operator.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Advanced Extensions: Pocket Calculator</h4>

    <p>Advanced extensions are optional features which you may complete for up to 4 additional points in the course. They are due by the <strong>final grading deadline (December 10, 2021)</strong>. They do not need to be completed by the deadline for this project. See the <a href="/syllabus.html#sec_adv_ext">syllabus</a> for details.</p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todoAE_1_i">Advanced Extension P0.1.i (1 extension point):</strong>
        Enable the user to clear the calculator by specifying &apos;c&apos; as the operator.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todoAE_1_ii">Advanced Extension P0.1.ii (2 extension points):</strong>
        Enable the user to store and load their current set of operations through a file named &quot;resultcalc.txt&quot; such that this equation can be used across multiple program executions.
