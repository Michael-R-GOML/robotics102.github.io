    <strong>Tutorial:</strong> Using the ROB 102 Navigation Web App
  </header>

  <p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/tutorials/webapp/nav-app-overview.png" alt="" /></span>
    The <strong>ROB 102 Navigation Web App</strong> is a web-based application that allows you to
    visualize the paths generated by your DFS, BFS, and A-STAR search algorithms.<br>
    Once you implement DFS, BFS, and A-STAR, you can use the nav_cli, which is included
    with the project 3 starter code, to generate output which the web app can visualize for
    you. This tutorial will show you how to generate those files on replit and use the
    webapp.

  <p>
    Before using the path planner on a given map, you may like to visualize the map
    to select the start and goal cells for you plan. To do this, we need to
    first download the map file which we could like to visualize to our computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To download a map file from replit, open the <strong>data</strong> folder, which is where all the
    maps are stored, find the map you would like to download, then click the 3 dots
    that appear next to the file when you hover over it. This will give you a drop down menu
    where you can select the <strong>Download</strong> option to download the file to your
    computer.

    Once download, navigate to <a href="robotics102.github.io/nav-app/">robotics102.github.io/nav-app/</a>
    Once open, click <strong>Upload Map File</strong>. This will open your file explorer where
    you can then select the map file that you downloaded, and upload it to the nav app. Once uploaded
    the map will automatically display. We now have the ability to click on the map to retrieve
    different cell values from the map to use to generate plans.
